# Purpose

The next step in our interview process is to share code with one another. Below we have described a simple app which once delivered should open up a nice dialog around what you think good code looks like. After completing the project described below, you will have an opportunity to share with our team all of your thoughts regarding your approach and implementation of this task. Afterword, we will take a deeper look at our production code base and have an open discussion about our approach and implementation.

# Project Description

This project is about exposing a single web api endpoint that returns the most recent post authored by each user from a third party data set.

## Requirements

- The data set is located here https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Name Your Project FieldLevel so that you have a FieldLevel.csproj inside of a folder called FieldLevel:  FieldLevel\FieldLevel.csproj
- Results should display the most recent post authored by each user. Use post.id to determine recency.
- Regardless of the frequency at which your endpoint is requested across multi devices, the third party data set should not be requested more than once per minute.
- Please do not spend more than a 4 hours on this task.

# Project Deliverable
